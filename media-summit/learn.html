                    <h4>For us, the term Professional Learning Networks (PLNs) represents any group who engages in collaborative learning with others outside of their everyday community of practice; with the ultimate aim of improving outcomes for children
                        (Brown & Poortman, 2018). Our interest in this area stems from the increased focus on school improvement to better prepare children and young people for the demands of the 21st century.</h4>

                    <h4>One implication of this focus is that teachers need to be high-level knowledge workers who constantly develop their own knowledge and that of the profession. Achieving this goal depends on high quality, continuing professional development.
                        Networks of educators, (from different schools) such as teacher design teams, research learning networks, data teams and lesson study teams appear to provide such promising forms of teacher development.</h4>
